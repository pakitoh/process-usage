## A simple metered billing system

### Introduction

We define a simple billing system which feeds off a list of usage records. Usage records designate events happening on resources. Each usage record is represented as a map of the following form:

`
{:usage/event     :usage.event/create
 :usage/resource  :usage.resource/object
 :usage/uuid      #uuid "d8377d93-db71-488a-b894-54a962760bea"
 :usage/account   #uuid "ee12577c-983f-4729-a0e9-c5789a906c04"
 :usage/timestamp #inst "2017-03-10T00:00:00.000-00:00"}
`
>    :usage/event may be any of :usage.event/create or :usage.event/destroy.
>    :usage/resource may be any of :usage.resource/vm or :usage.resource/object.
>    :usage/uuid designates the resource the event pertains to.
>    :usage/account designates the account owning the designated resource.
>    :usage/timestamp designates the time at which the event occurred.

### Objective
Write a function process-usage which computes a collection of usage records and produces a collection of billing statements, one per account:

`
(def events
  [{:usage/event     :usage.event/create
    :usage/resource  :usage.resource/object
    :usage/uuid      #uuid "d8377d93-db71-488a-b894-54a962760bea"
    :usage/account   #uuid "ee12577c-983f-4729-a0e9-c5789a906c04"
    :usage/timestamp #inst "2017-03-10T00:00:00.000-00:00"}
   {:usage/event     :usage.event/destroy
    :usage/resource  :usage.resource/object
    :usage/uuid      #uuid "d8377d93-db71-488a-b894-54a962760bea"
    :usage/account   #uuid "ee12577c-983f-4729-a0e9-c5789a906c04"
    :usage/timestamp #inst "2017-03-10T01:00:00.000-00:00"}])

(assert (= (process-usage events)
           [{:usage/resource  :usage.resource/object
             :usage/uuid      #uuid "d8377d93-db71-488a-b894-54a962760bea"
             :usage/account   #uuid "ee12577c-983f-4729-a0e9-c5789a906c04"
             :usage/duration  60}]))
`

### Details

Please write the code in a single .clj file which pulls-in no additional dependencies beyond [clj-time "0.13.0"] if necessary. The namespace should be named metered.usage.

Please respect function names as a test-suite will be ran on the provided code.
